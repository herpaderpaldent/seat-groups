## FAQ:

### Some Member does not get the roles he is supposed to
Make sure that all of your usergroups have a main_character set

### I just updated SeAT Groups but the fix is not working
Restart supervisor or `seat-worker` container to load the new code to workers.

### I have set an affiliation but it isn't shown
Make sure you are running the latest version. Later versions interfered with AdBlockers. Disable your adblocker temporally as work around and update.
